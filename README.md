## What is this?
It's a crypt3() based tripper, used to generate tripcodes in pages like 2ch or 4chan.

## What is a tripper?
A tripper is a tool used to generate cryptographic hashes which have the objective of providing security and/or uniquity.

## Is it fast?
Not by any means.<br>
In my PC (4790k, 16GB, AMD 290) it only goes up to 100ktrips/sec.

## Why did you make this?
I wanted to learn more about cryptograhpic hashes.<br>
It was hella fun to make.

## But it could be faster if...
You are welcome to fork this github.
