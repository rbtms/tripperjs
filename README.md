# tripperjs

## Description
Rust-transpiled WASM implementation of the 2ch/4chan tripcode generation algorithm.<br>

## Try it at
https://rbtms.github.io/tripperjs/

## What is this?
It's a crypt3() based tripper, used to generate tripcodes in pages like 2ch or 4chan.

## What is a tripper?
A tripper is a tool used to generate cryptographic hashes which have the objective of providing security and/or uniquity.

## Why did you make this?
I wanted to learn more about how crypt(3) worked.<br>
It was hella fun to make.

## But it could be faster if...
